    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <h3 align="left">Objective</h3>
    <p align="left">

      The Resistance: Avalon is the game of hidden loyalty. Players are either Loyal Servants of
      Arther fighting for Goodness and honor or aligned with the Evil ways of Mordred.

      Good wins the game by successfully completing three Quests. Evil wins if three Quests end in
      failure. Evil can also win by assassinating Merlin at game's end or if a Quest cannot be
      undertaken.

      Players may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. Discussion,
      deception, accusation, and logical deduction are all equally important in order for Good to
      prevail or Evil to rule the day.
    </p>
    <h3 align='left'> Game play</h3>
    <p align='left'> The game consists of several rounds; each round has a team building phase and
      a Quest phase.

      In the team building phase the leader proposes a team to complete a Quest - all the players
      will either approve the proposed team and move to the quest phase, or reject the proposed
      team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a team is
      approved.

      In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the team will determine if the Quest is
      succesfull.</p>
    <h3 align='left'> Team building phase</h3>
    <p align='left'>Team Assignment: After appropriate discussion, the leader takes the required
      number of Team tokens and assigns each team token to any player. The leader can be on the
      team, but is not required to be so. Note a player may only be assigned one team token.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Team Vote</h3>
    <p align='left'>After appropriate discussion, the leader calsl for a vote on the team
      assignments. Each player, including the leader, secretly selects one vote card. When all
      players have their selected vote card ready, the leader asks for the votes to be revealed.
      All vote tokens are flipped over so everyone can see how you voted.

      The team is approved if the majority accepts. If the team is approved, play continues in the
      quest phase.

      If the team is rejected (a tied vote is also rejection), the leader passes clockwise and the
      team building phase is repeated.

      Evil wins the game if five teams are rejected in a single round.
    </p>
    <h3 align="left"> Quest phase</h3>
    <p align="left">The leader passes a set of Quest cards to each team member. Each player on the
      quest selects a quest card and plays it face down in from of themselves.

      The leader collects and shuffles the played quest cards before revealing. The quest is
      completed successfully only if all the cards revealed are success cards. The quest fails if
      one fail cards have been played.
    </p>
    <p align="left">Note: The 4th quest (and only the 4th quest) in games of 7 or more players
      require at least two Quest failed cards to be failed Quest. </p>
    <h3 align="left">End of the Game</h3>
    <p align="left">

      Arthur and Goodness prevail if the team of Good is able to successfully complete three quests
      without revealing Merlin's true identity.

      Mordred's dark forces of Evil win when three quests end in failure or are devious enough to
      force Merlin into the open.

      The game ends immediately after either 3 succesful or three failed quests. The evil players
      win if 3 quests fail and when 5 teams are rejected in a single round.
    </p>
    <h3 align="left">Assassinate Merlin - Evil's Last Chance</h3>
    <p align="left">If 3 quests are completed succesfully, the evil players will have a final
      opportunity to win the game by correctly naming which of the good players is Merlin.

      Without revealing any character cards, the evil players discuss and the player with the
      assasin character card will name one good player as Merlin.

      If the named player is Merlin, then Evil players win. If the evil players do not name Merlin,
      then the Good players win.</p>
